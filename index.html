                            <p>I passed the interview. I am officially in!</p>
                            <p> My interviewer is a very nice, friendly lady that I occasionally chatted with when I was in MakerPrep (a part-time course teaching JS fundamentals). The interview took about 90 mins. She started with asking my background and what brought me to MKS. This only took 5-10 minutes and we jumped right into coding. </p>
                            <p> I could not use console or google during the interview. If I was unsure about something or got stuck, I asked questions and she would ask me more questions, pointing me in the right direction. We started with simple questions and ended up with a more complex toy problem. Below are the questions I got asked: </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li> Create an array of five items and an object with three key value pairs</li>
                                <li> Access the third item in the array</li>
                                <li> Access the object value using both dot notation and bracket notation</li>
                                <li> Write several higher order functions: each, map, filter, reduce. <b>This is a big part. Make sure you understand higher order functions and know how to use callbacks before your interview.</b> </li>
                                <li> Toy problem: The one I got is longest palindrome: given a string like "My dad is a racecar athlete", I had to write a function returning the longest palindrome in a string. So the output is "a racecar a", including the spaces. Of course, you might get a different toy problem. The interviewer wants to know <b>how you approach a problem, how you communicate your thoughts, and if you are a nice person to pair program with. </b> </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Prework is released!</p>
                            <p>I scanned through all the prework content and set up a plan with my study group buddy, Ryan. The prework takes about 60-80 hours to finish so students are expected to spend at least 10 hours each week. Ryan and I expect to spend more than 10 hours a week so we can finish the entire prework way before deadlines and possibly go through second iteration. </p>

                            <p> Birthday celebration with JS Koans.My 28th birthday. Best to celebrate it with something fun -- JS Koans. Ryan and I started working on the Koans. They are great review practices, reinforcing our JS fundamentals. </p>
                            <p> I was confused about the JS sorting function, and Ryan's clarification helps: </p>
                            <p><code>Array.sort()</code> sorts the array based on what the expression evaluates to. If the expression evaluates to a negative number, the first argument will be moved to the left and the second arugment moved to the right, if the expression evaluates to 0, there will be no change, <b> if the expression evaluates to a positive number then the first arguement will be moved to the right and the second aruguement moved to the left</b>.
                                <p> Consider the following array: [1, 5, 3]. If the expression compares a - b, because 1 - 5 is -4 then a will be moved to the left and b to the right. However, if the expression was b - a, then the expression would evaluate to 4 and b would then be shifted to the left and a to the right => [5, 1, 3]</p>

                            <p> Rewriting underscore.js is a big part of Makersqaure prework curriculum. Students are required to rewrite some useful functions like reject, contains, delay, and shuffle.  Many functions are built upon another function, so it is a great opportunity to practice higher order functions and using callbacks. Some functions are easier to write like each, map; some are really challenging like memoize. Thanks to Ryan, I managed to have it working... </p>

                            <p>It has been 9 days since the prework was released, and I am about halfway done.  Feeling great.  The second half would be more challenging. Looking forward to it.</p>

                            <p> Twittler project is done!</p>
                            <p> I had been struggling with the twittler project for the past few days. Twittler is a very simple twitster clone web app that randomly generate nonsense tweets. Visitors can also create their tweets. The HTML and CSS are easy. Because I am still weak in jQuery, it took me 10+ hours finishing up this app. (Maker Square expects 4-6 hours of work.) </p>

                            <p>I am not complaining though...I truly enjoy working on this project, and I was surprised that how much I have learned from building this simple app. I plan to rewrite it before day 1 and see if I will be able to write the functions differently and how long it will take me. </p>
