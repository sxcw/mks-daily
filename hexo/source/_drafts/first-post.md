** I passed the interview! **

I passed the interview. I am officially in!

My interviewer is a very nice, friendly lady that I occasionally chatted with when I was in MakerPrep (a part-time course teaching JS fundamentals). The interview took about 90 mins. She started with asking my background and what brought me to MKS. This only took 5-10 minutes and we jumped right into coding.

I could not use console or google during the interview. If I was unsure about something or got stuck, I asked questions and she would ask me more questions, pointing me in the right direction. We started with simple questions and ended up with a more complex toy problem. Below are the questions I got asked:

Create an array of five items and an object with three key value pairs
Access the third item in the array
Access the object value using both dot notation and bracket notation
Write several higher order functions: each, map, filter, reduce. This is a big part. Make sure you understand higher order functions and know how to use callbacks before your interview.
Toy problem: The one I got is longest palindrome: given a string like "My dad is a racecar athlete", I had to write a function returning the longest palindrome in a string. So the output is "a racecar a", including the spaces. Of course, you might get a different toy problem. The interviewer wants to know _how you approach a problem, how you communicate your thoughts, and if you are a nice person to pair program with._
