I scanned through all the prework content and set up a plan with my study group buddy, Ryan. The prework takes about 60-80 hours to finish so students are expected to spend at least 10 hours each week. Ryan and I expect to spend more than 10 hours a week so we can finish the entire prework way before deadlines and possibly go through second iteration.
