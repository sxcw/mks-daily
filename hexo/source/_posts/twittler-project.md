I had been struggling with the twittler project for the past few days. Twittler is a very simple twitster clone web app that randomly generate nonsense tweets. Visitors can also create their tweets. The HTML and CSS are easy. Because I am still weak in jQuery, it took me 10+ hours finishing up this app. (Maker Square expects 4-6 hours of work.) 

I am not complaining though...I truly enjoy working on this project, and I was surprised that how much I have learned from building this simple app. I plan to rewrite it before day 1 and see if I will be able to write the functions differently and how long it will take me.
