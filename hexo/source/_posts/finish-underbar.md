I finished underbar part 1 and 2 today! Congratulations to myself!

Rewriting underscore.js is a big part of Makersqaure prework curriculum. Students are required to rewrite some useful functions like reject, contains, delay, and shuffle.  Many functions are built upon another function, so it is a great opportunity to practice higher order functions and using callbacks. Some functions are easier to write like each, map; some are really challenging like memoize. Thanks to Ryan, I managed to have it working... 

It has been 2 weeks since the prework was released, and I am about halfway done.  Feeling great.  The second half would be more challenging. Looking forward to it.
